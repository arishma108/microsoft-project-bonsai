### The Smart Way to Build Smarter Systems
Autonomous AI is powerful, but let’s be real—building it as a single, monolithic structure is like trying to construct a skyscraper with no blueprints and a single tool. It’s messy, inflexible, and doomed to collapse under its own complexity. That’s why modular design is the golden ticket to creating intelligent systems that are not only smarter but also sustainable.

Here’s the deal:

- Modular systems are the MVPs of maintainability. If one piece falters, you fix or upgrade that piece—no need to overhaul the entire operation. Think of it like swapping out a flat tire instead of scrapping the car.
- Testing and certifying? Way simpler. Smaller pieces mean fewer variables to juggle and clearer accountability for performance.
- One size doesn’t fit all. Different situations demand different skills or decision-making strategies. Modularity lets you tailor solutions without reinventing the wheel.
- Learning thrives in bite-sized chunks. Just like humans, AI systems learn better when mastering individual tasks before connecting the dots.
- Teach smart, not hard. Breaking complex processes into smaller lessons makes it easier to teach both humans and machines.

In this repo, I'm diving into three tried-and-true brain design patterns that will let me build modular AI systems for practically any application.

### The Big Three Brain Design Patterns
- <b>Perception Pattern</b>
<br>Picture this: A Machine Learning (ML) model handles high-level perception tasks—computer vision, auditory classification, predictions, you name it. The insights are then handed over to a decision-making module (usually Deep Reinforcement Learning or DRL). It’s the classic “see-think-do” trifecta.

- <b>Function Pattern</b>
<br>This one’s about independence. If you have separate tasks that don’t overlap—like controlling individual fingers versus the elbow on a robotic arm—you can break them into independent modules. Each module gets its own “knob” to control its part, like running different sections of a factory assembly line or tuning independent chemical reactors in a plant.

- <b>Strategy Pattern</b>
<br>When you’re dealing with similar actions but different scenarios, the Strategy Pattern shines. Think of it as creating multiple playbooks for a machine operator: one for startup, one for high-demand operations, and another for low-demand periods. Each strategy gets its own module, and a decision-making module picks the right one on the fly.

By the end of this I will have a playbook for designing modular AI brains that are:

- Tailored for industrial applications.
- Built on rock-solid design patterns.
- Enhanced by the best practices in Machine Teaching to tackle real-world challenges.

### What I Need to Get Started
- A basic grasp of Automated Intelligence.
- A working understanding of Autonomous Intelligence.
- Familiarity with the principles of Machine Teaching.
